CSS MEDIA QUERIES

They are a feature in CSS3 which allows you to specify when certain CSS rules should be applied.
This allows you to apply a special CSS for mobile, or adjust a layout for print.

Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

width and height of the viewport
width and height of the device
orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
resolution
